  Better Screenreader Experiences with CSS (with Ben Myers)
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  This app was built live on <em>Learn With Jason</em> and it was super fun and I’m sad you weren’t there.
</h3>
<p align="center">
  But don’t worry! You can still: 
  <a href="https://www.learnwithjason.dev/better-screenreader-experiences-with-css"><strong>watch the video</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://better-screenreader-css.netlify.app"><strong>see the demo</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/BenDMyers/learn-with-jason-screenreader-experiences&utm_source=learnwithjason&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=devex"><strong>deploy this project</strong></a> · 
  <a href="https://jason.af/lwj/schedule"><strong>see upcoming episodes</strong></a>
</p>

After an introduction to how we can navigate with screenreaders, Ben Myers will teach us how we can use CSS to influence what screenreaders will announce.
