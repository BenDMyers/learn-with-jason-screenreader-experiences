  Respondents are predominantly comfortable with allowing screen reader
  detection by web sites. However, this favorability has decreased over time -
  78.4% of respondents to this question in 2014 were very or somewhat
  comfortable with allowing screen reader detection, compared to 62.5% in 2019.
  Respondents with disabilities were significantly more likely to be favorable
  of detection than respondents without disabilities.
